To use SQL Data Reader (SDR), follow these steps:

    File Placement: Place your .sql files in the same directory as the SDR.py script.

    Execution: Open your command line and run the script using Python:

    bash

python SDR.py

Verbose Option: If you want detailed logs during the execution, run the script with the verbose flag:

bash

    python SDR.py --verbose

After running the script, the extracted email addresses will be saved to a file named extracted_emails.txt.
